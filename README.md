# Hospital-Patients-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI Desktop)
## Project Objective
To analyze hospital data, extract meaningful insights on patient demographics, diagnosis patterns, and treatment status, and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides hospital management with actionable insights for better decision-making.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/Anujk9213/Hospital-Patients-Data-Analysis/blob/main/hospital%20patients%20report.pbix">Dataset</a>

## Question (KPIs)
- What is the distribution of patients by gender and department?
- Which departments have the highest and lowest number of patients?
- How has the number of patient admissions and discharges changed over the last year, and are there any noticeable trends?
- How are patients distributed across different statuses?
- How many patients are assigned to each doctor?

## Process
- Cleaning, Transformming and prepare hospital data for analysis.
- Created interactive visualizations.
- Analyzed patient distribution by department, gender, diagnosis, and status.
- Built quarterly trend reports to track hospital workload over time.

## Project Insights
- Pediatrics and Gynaecology have the highest number of patients assigned.
- Active, Discharged, and Under Treatment patients are almost equally distributed (~34% each), showing a balanced hospital workload.
- Female patients dominate Pediatrics and Gynaecology.
- Male patients are higher in Surgery.
- Other departments show a nearly balanced male-female ratio.
- Fracture and Stroke are the most common diagnoses.
- Diabetes has the lowest number of patients compared to other conditions.
- In Q1 2020, discharged patients were higher compared to active and under-treatment cases.
- By October 2020, “Under Treatment” cases increased sharply (up to 81).
- This indicates a rising workload toward the end of the year.

## Conclusion:
"The dashboard shows that Pediatrics and Gynaecology face the highest patient loads, with Fracture and Stroke as leading diagnoses. The rise in “Under Treatment” cases indicates growing hospital pressure."

## Recommendations:
"To improve, hospitals should allocate more resources to high-demand departments, enhance treatment for common diagnoses, and closely monitor patient status trends for better planning."
